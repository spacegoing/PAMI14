 The code has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and Matlab R2012b. It builds
 on Valdimir Kolmogorov's C++ maxflow library for inference and Matlab's
 quadratic program solver for inference. Note that both these codes
 are distributed under their own independent license agreements.

 To download the maxflow library and build the inference code run the
 "build.m" script from Matlab.

 To generate results from the ICML 2011 paper, run the "icml2011.m" script.

 To generate results from the PAMI 2014 paper, run the "pami2014.m" script.
